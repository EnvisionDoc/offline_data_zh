# Workflow monitor overview

After a workflow is published, the workflow is automatically run according to the scheduling parameters or manually when you perform the pre-running action, you can then view the running status and perform monitoring actions through the workflow monitor.

## Key concepts

**Instance**

Once a workflow is triggered automatically according to scheduling parameter or manually by you, an instance will be generated . An instance represents a snapshot of a workflow being executed at some time. An instance contains task runtime, run status, and run log and other information.


## Major functions

The workflow monitor allows you to do the following things:
- View details about your workflows and perform the workflow monitoring actions such as pre-running, starting, pausing the workflows.
- View details about instances for each workflow and perform the instance monitoring actions such as re-running and stopping.
