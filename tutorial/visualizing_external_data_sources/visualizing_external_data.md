# Tutorial Overview

## Scenario

In [Tutorial - Integrating External Data Sources](/docs/offline-data/en/2.0.9/tutorial/integrating_external_data_sources/index.html), some employee data is integrated from external data source to EnOS Hive. In this tutorial, synchronize the integrated employee data from EnOS Hive to the Report Database, create datasets with the synchronized data, and then generate a data report for the employee information.

The scenario is depicted in the following chart:

This tutorial walks you through a typical path of processing integrated data and generating a data report with the integrated and processed data, which is:

- Creating a target table in the Report Database
- Synchronizing data from Hive to the Report Database
- Creating datasets with the synchronized data
- Generating a data report with the datasets
