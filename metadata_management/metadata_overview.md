# Metadata Query

Metadata mainly records the definition of the model in the data warehouse and the mapping relationship between the levels. Metadata query provides a unified dataset view, including Hive metadata information, and metadata information corresponding to the dataset of the report library. In development, engineers can centrally view the table schema and its attributes through metadata query to assist in data development.

Through tree navigation, search Hive or MySQL tables on demand and you can view table paths, structures, and attributes after selecting the table.
